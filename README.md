Evolving Creatures

I tried to implement the paper from Karl Sim's Evolved Virtual Creatures with some adjustments.
It uses Java, JmonkeyEngine, Bullet Physics and a tiny neural network to control motion.

The purpose is to evolve a virtual worm creature to follow a target.
It never worked well :(

Sorry
